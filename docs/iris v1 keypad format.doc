Iris v1 alertme KeyPad format.

 * Keypad is device type 28 (0x1C)
 * Most messages are sent and received on the Attribute Cluster (0x00C0).
 * The standard device messages (Hello and Lifesign) are sent on the Join and General Clusters, as usual.
 * The lifesign will be sent every 2 minutes, in common with other AlertMe sleepy end devices.
 * 
 * The keypad is responsible for;
 *   1. Driving its LEDs according to its state (see ATTRID_KEYPADSTATE attribute below),
 *   2. Accumulating a PIN
 *   3. Sending an action key and/or PIN when appropriate
 *   4. Making sound sequences on demand
 * 
 * The keypad expects to be told its state, and may also send a triplet of attributes whenever an "action" key is used.
 * The triplet is ATTRID_PIN (if there is one), ATTRID_ACTIONKEY_ID and ATTRID_ACTIONKEY_TIME.
 * 
 * While an actionKey is held down, the keypad will send ATTRID_ACTIONKEY_ID and ATTRID_ACTIONKEY_TIME once per second.
 * Itâ€™ll also send an ATTRID_PIN (if available) with the first ATTRID_ACTIONKEY_ID.
 * 
 * If a PIN has been typed in, but no action key pressed within 2 seconds of the last digit, then a single ATTRID_PIN
 * will be sent to the hub.

The keypad polls for its arming state with

Cluster:00C0  CMD00 Map:[20,00]
once you send the state it will stop.
It also does this when you send it a pending arming command
===========================================================
Typing the pin "1111" sends 
     
 Cluster:00C0 CMD:0A MAP:[21, 00, 42, 04, 31, 31, 31, 31]
 
 21 = PIN Elclosed        ^
 04 = Size of the PIN                  ^
 31 = the ASCII code of 1                  ^   ^   ^   ^
===========================================================

Pressing button 1 on the keypad sends 

 Cluster:00C0 CMD:0A MAP:[21, 00, 42, 01, 31] 

 21 = PIN Elclosed        ^
 04 = Size of the PIN                  ^
 31 = the ASCII code of 1                  ^ 
 
 ===========================================================
 
 Pressing a ACTION key (OFF ON PARTIAL PANIC # * ) sends
 
 Cluster:00C0 CMD:0A MAP:[22, 00, 09, 00, 48]
 Cluster:00C0 CMD:0A MAP:[23, 00, 09, 00, 48, 23, 00, 09, 00, 48]
 Cluster:00C0 CMD:0A MAP:[23, 00, 09, 00, 48] <- This repeats 
 
 22 = Action key pressed  ^
 23 = Action key Released ^
 48 = The ASCII code H  (HOME)             ^
 48 = The ASCII code H  Next command in qwery (HOME)           ^ 
 The other data is unkown 
 
 OFF sends     H=HOME
 ON  Sends     A=AWAY
 PARTIAL sends N=NIGHT
 PANIC sends   P=PANIC
 * # send      * and #  
 ==============================================================
 undocumented.
 Cluster:00C0 CMD:01 MAP:[01, ---
 Replies with what you sent it. I think this is a error return
 As sending in the correct format ever generates anything.
